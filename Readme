ðŸŒ¾ Context This dataset is structured to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on several agro-climatic parameters. It is typically used in precision agriculture and machine learning applications aimed at supporting farmers, agricultural advisors, and policymakers.

Features (Inputs):

N â€“ Nitrogen content in the soil (in mg/kg) P â€“ Phosphorus content in the soil (in mg/kg) K â€“ Potassium content in the soil (in mg/kg) temperature â€“ Average temperature in Â°C humidity â€“ Average relative humidity in % ph â€“ Soil pH value rainfall â€“ Rainfall in mm Label (Output):

label â€“ The crop most suited to the given conditions (e.g., rice, maize, cotton, etc.)
